technologies are unit upgrades. unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet.\nplayers place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.\neach technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower-right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology’s color.\na technology’s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.\nunit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.\nthere are four colors of technologies as follows:\nbiotic\nwarfare\npropulsion\ncybernetic\nmost technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower-left corner of the card. each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.\na technology card’s prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.\na player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the “technology” strategy card during the action phase. other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.\nto research technology, a player gains that technology card from their technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.\nplayers place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.\na player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction.\nwhen researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology’s prerequisites to research it. to satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, that player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card they wish to research.\nprerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower-left corner of the card.\nunit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.\nplayers may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.\na technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.\nwhen researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card they are researching.\nif the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.\nthe nekro virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two “valefar assimilator” faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.\nbasic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for “valefar assimilator.”\nif a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a valefar assimilator token on it, the nekro virus player places that technology in their play area; it is not removed from the game.\nif a valefar assimilator token is removed from the saar “floating factory” unit upgrade, each of the nekro virus’ space docks must be placed on an eligible planet they control in that space dock’s system, or the space dock is returned to their reinforcements.\nif a valefar assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the nekro virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of the nekro virus player’s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.\nthe nekro virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. if the nekro virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same valefar assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.\nwhen a valefar assimilator token is on a technology, that technology’s color and type count toward objectives."},{"id":"Glossary|TECHNOLOGY (STRATEGY CARD)","path":["Glossary","TECHNOLOGY
